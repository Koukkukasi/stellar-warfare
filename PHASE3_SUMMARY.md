# Phase 3: Ship Classes System - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Server-side)

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Ship Type Configuration System ✅
**File**: `server/ship-types.js` (NEW)

Three ship classes with unique stats:
- **Interceptor** (Cyan): Fast, fragile skirmisher
  - Max Speed: 400, Health: 60, Fire Rate: 200ms
  - Role: Hit-and-run tactics

- **Gunship** (Gold): Balanced all-rounder
  - Max Speed: 300, Health: 100, Fire Rate: 300ms
  - Role: Versatile combat

- **Cruiser** (Red): Slow tank with heavy weapons
  - Max Speed: 200, Health: 150, Fire Rate: 500ms
  - Role: Frontline destroyer

### 2. Server Integration ✅
**File**: `server/game.js` (MODIFIED)

**Changes Made**:
1. **Import ship configuration system** (line 3)
   ```javascript
   const { getShipConfig, getDefaultShip } = require('./ship-types');
   ```

2. **Modified `addPlayer()` method** (lines 375-430)
   - Accepts `playerData.shipType` parameter
   - Applies ship-specific stats to player object
   - Sends `shipConfig` back to client

3. **Ship-Specific Player Properties**:
   - `shipType`, `shipName`: Ship identification
   - `maxSpeed`, `acceleration`, `rotationSpeed`, `friction`: Movement stats
   - `fireRate`, `projectileSpeed`, `projectileDamage`, `projectileLifetime`: Combat stats
   - `size`, `color`, `shape`: Visual properties
   - `maxHealth`: Ship-specific health pool

### 3. Physics System Updates (PENDING)
The following methods need updates to use ship-specific stats:

#### `updatePlayerPhysics()` - Need to modify:
```javascript
// Currently uses hardcoded values:
const accelForce = 400;
const drag = 0.98;
// maxSpeed from entity.maxSpeed (already dynamic)

// Should use:
const accelForce = entity.acceleration || 400;
const friction = entity.friction || 0.98;
```

#### `respawnPlayer()` - Need to modify:
```javascript
// Currently:
player.health = 100;

// Should be:
player.health = player.maxHealth || 100;
```

#### `handlePlayerInput()` - Need to modify:
```javascript
// Currently:
player.weaponCooldown = 0.25;

// Should be:
player.weaponCooldown = (player.fireRate || 300) / 1000;
```

#### `spawnProjectile()` - Need to modify:
```javascript
// Currently uses hardcoded values:
const projectileSpeed = 600;
const spawnOffset = 25;
damage: 20,
lifetime: 2.0

// Should use owner's ship stats:
const projectileSpeed = owner.projectileSpeed || 600;
const spawnOffset = owner.size || 25;
damage: owner.projectileDamage || 20,
lifetime: owner.projectileLifetime || 2.0
```

## Testing Status

### Server-Side: READY ✅
- Ship configuration system created
- Player spawning accepts ship types
- Defaults to Gunship if not specified

### Client-Side: TODO ⏳
- [ ] Ship selection UI
- [ ] Render different ship shapes/colors
- [ ] Display ship stats in HUD
- [ ] Ship selection screen before joining game

### Physics Integration: TODO ⏳
- [ ] Apply acceleration/friction from ship stats
- [ ] Use ship-specific fire rates
- [ ] Use ship-specific projectile stats
- [ ] Respawn with correct ship health

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete Physics Integration):
1. Apply remaining updates to `game.js`:
   - updatePlayerPhysics() - use acceleration/friction
   - respawnPlayer() - use maxHealth
   - handlePlayerInput() - use fireRate
   - spawnProjectile() - use projectile stats

2. Test ship differences:
   - Start server with Interceptor (should be fast)
   - Start server with Cruiser (should be slow, tanky)
   - Verify different fire rates work

### Short-Term (Client UI):
3. Add ship selection screen
4. Display ship type in player HUD
5. Render ships with different colors/shapes
6. Show ship stats overlay

### Future (Game Modes):
7. Implement Domination mode
8. Implement Planet Assault mode
9. Improve AI bot pathfinding

## How to Test

### Server Test (Current State):
```bash
cd C:/Users/ilmiv/stellar-warfare
npm start

# Server will use Gunship by default for all players
# To test different ships, modify client connection to send:
# socket.emit('joinGame', { name: 'Player1', shipType: 'interceptor' })
```

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Players spawn with ship stats
- ✅ gameJoined event includes shipConfig
- ⏳ Ship stats not yet affecting gameplay (physics update needed)
